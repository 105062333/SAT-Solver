## Boolean Satisfiability Problem
#### A satisfiability problem in conjunctive normal form consists of a the conjunction of a number of clauses, where is clause is a disjunction of a number of variables or their negations. If we let xi represent variables that can assume only the values true or false, then a sample formula in conjunctive normal form would be (v1∨v2∨v3)∧(¬v2∨v4∨v3)∧(¬v2∨¬v4∨v3)∧(v1∨¬v3∨v5) where ∨ represents the or boolean connective, ∧ represents and and ¬vi is the negation of vi.
#### Given a set of clauses C1,C2,…,Cm on the variables v1,v2,…,vn, the satisfiability problem is to determine if the formula C1∧C2∧⋯∧Cm is satisfiable. That is, is there an assignment of values to the variables so that the above formula evaluates to true. Clearly, this requires that each Cj evaluate to true.
